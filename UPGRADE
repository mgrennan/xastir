Previous Install Notes:
-----------------------
     Backup all previous installed data!

  Xastir 0.1.0 users (if there are any of you still around!):

     For Xastir version 0.1.0 and below there are new file locations:
     All map data, TNC config data, and support files now go under the
     /usr/local/xastir directory. All personal config data, logs, etc are
     user the (user home dir)/.xastir directory (which will be created after
     xastir starts). You can copy (after your first xastir startup) your
     xastir.cnf file to your (user home dir)/.xastir/config directory. MAKE
     SURE YOU DELETE all lines referencing Files! Xastir may not run properly
     if you don't!

     If you have Xastir version 0.1.1 then your files are in the right place,
     just follow the typical build instructions.

  Xastir 0.2.0 users:

     Xastir 0.2.0 and newer have new device controls so you will need to
     setup your devices again with 0.2.0.
     Look at File->Configure->Interfaces and File->Configure->Defaults

  Xastir 0.3.x, 0.9.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.0:

     Versions above 1.1 drop privileges if they are run as root. If any of the
     Xastir files are owned by root, on only readable by root, they will cause
     problems. Fix these files by "chmod 644 filename" where filename is the
     problem file.

  Xastir 1.2.1 or later CVS:

     On or about July 3rd, 2003, the locations of the Xastir system directories
     were changed.  Existing users must go through this procedure in order to
     convert to the new directory structure.  Note that if you've installed
     Xastir from RPM's or other packages, the migration scripts
     (xastir-migrate.sh and xastir-fixcfg.sh) may not work properly for you.
     These scripts are designed to move Xastir's system directories only from
     /usr/local/xastir to the new locations.  If your Xastir files are
     installed elsewhere (/usr/share/xastir, /usr/lib/xastir, /usr/bin), you
     may need to perform the alternate procedure listed below under ALTERNATE.

        cd src/xastir
        cvs update
        ./bootstrap.sh
        ./configure
        make
        Shut down any running Xastir instances
        cd scripts
        su
        ./xastir-migrate.sh (this will move the Xastir system directories)
        make install (or make install-strip)
        chmod 4555 /usr/local/bin/xastir (only if required)
        exit (from root)
        ./xastir-fixcfg.sh (run this for each user that has ever run Xastir)


     ALTERNATE PROCEDURE (see note above):

        Remove the installed Xastir using the system tools for doing so (apt,
        rpm, etc).  You'll probably wish to keep your maps directories and
        your ~/.xastir/config/xastir.cnf files.  Make sure to delete any
        "callpass" or "xastir" binaries as well.

        Remove your ~/.xastir directory, subdirectories, and all contents
        (remember to save your xastir.cnf file if some of the settings are
        important to you).

        Move your maps directory to "/usr/local/share/xastir/maps"

        Configure/compile/install the new Xastir.

        When you start up the new Xastir, it will create a new xastir.cnf file
        with the proper directory paths defined in order to find the maps.
        
     After you start the new Xastir, you'll need to re-index all maps.  The
     Xastir binary should be in /usr/local/bin/xastir if you installed from
     sources.  Xastir files are now installed in:

        /usr/local/bin/
        /usr/local/lib/xastir/
        /usr/local/man/
        /usr/local/share/xastir/*
