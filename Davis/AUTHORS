    First, thanks go out to the great folks at the xastir team - a
    wonderful APRS application set and helpful folks!

    Thanks also to Andreas Muller, author of meteo and a great
    resource for information and help.
    
    Elements of this software are taken from wx200d ver 1.2
    by Tim Witham, and it is modeled after that application.
			
    Finally, thanks to the MySQL folks for the key element - the
    database.
