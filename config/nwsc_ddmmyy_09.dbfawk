# This dbfawk file is used to map arbitrary dbf data that accompanies
# a shapefile into Xastir canoncical values of:
#   key     - search key
#   lanes   - width of feature (usually a road but applies to rivers, etc. too)
#   color   - color to draw the road
#   name    - name of the road for labels
#   filled  - whether a polygon is drawn filled or not
#   fill_color - color to fill polygon with
#   label_color - color for label
#   pattern - line pattern for road, river, etc.
#   display_level - highest zoom level at which to display the feature
#   label_level - highest zoom level at which to display the label
#   symbol  - 3 char 'TIO': table, ID, overlay
#
# NOTE: This file format is modeled after awk but is nowhere near awk
#  compatible.

# This file is used to map NWS county polygon shapefiles
# which are named c_ddmmyy.dbf.  These are used for WX alerts but can also
# be used as a map of all US counties.  For the WX alert feature, the
# key is set to the concatentation of the STATE and FIPS county code
# in the same format as the alert->title (e.g. WI_C037).
#
# This DBFAWK file matches the set of county shapefiles that was published
# by NOAA in 2009, and differs from the earlier format.  Shapefiles from 2008
# are matched by the file "nwsc_ddmmyy.dbfawk" instead.
