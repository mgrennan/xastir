# This dbfawk file is used to map arbitrary dbf data that
# accompanies a shapefile into Xastir canonical values of:
#
#   key     - search key
#   lanes   - width of feature (usually a road but applies to rivers, etc. too)
#   color   - color to draw the road
#   name    - name of the road for labels
#   filled  - whether a polygon is drawn filled or not
#   fill_color - color to fill polygon with
#   pattern - line pattern for road, river, etc. (0 - solid; 1 - dash; 2 - double dash)
#   display_level - highest zoom level at which to display the feature
#   label_level - highest zoom level at which to display the label
#   symbol  - 3 char 'TIO': table, ID, overlay
#
# NOTE: This file format is modeled after awk but is nowhere near
# awk compatible.

# This file is used to map OSM shapefiles by "Cloudmade" which are
# named "*_water.dbf" and "*_coastline.dbf".  Unfortunately both
# DBF files have the same signature, so we need to have this dbfawk
# file match both of them.

# BEGIN is called once per dbf file which contains multiple records.
BEGIN {
# dbfinfo is the "signature" of the dbf file listing the column
# names in order. dbfinfo should match the dbf file that we say this
# dbfawk file goes with.
dbfinfo="NATURAL:NAME";

# dbffields is which of the above fields we actually want to look
# at.  No point reading dbffields that are not looked at further.
dbffields="NATURAL:NAME";

# BEGIN_RECORD is called once per dbf record which contains multiple
# fields. Use this rule to re-initialize variables between records.
# use color 11 to highlight stuff that isn't properly mapped.
