# This dbfawk file is used to map arbitrary dbf data that accompanies
# a shapefile into Xastir canoncical values of:
#   key     - search key
#   lanes   - width of feature (usually a road but applies to rivers, etc. too)
#   color   - color to draw the road
#   name    - name of the road for labels
#   filled  - whether a polygon is drawn filled or not
#   fill_color - color to fill polygon with
#   pattern - line pattern for road, river, etc. (0 - solid; 1 - dash; 2 - double dash)
#   display_level - highest zoom level at which to display the feature
#   label_level - highest zoom level at which to display the label
#   symbol  - 3 char 'TIO': table, ID, overlay
# NOTE: This file format is modeled after awk but is nowhere near awk
#  compatible.
