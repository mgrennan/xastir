# TNC Init file for KENWOOD D700.  Also reported to work with the
# Alinco DR-135TP radio (with the EJ-41U TNC which also uses a Tasco
# TNC just like the Kenwoods).  Perhaps works with the Alinco DR-635
# radio (with the EJ-50U TNC) too.
#
# NOTE:  TXD on a D700A is fixed at 500ms (1/2 second) in "APRS"
# mode.  In "packet" mode we can change the txd to other values.
