# This configuration sets up Control-E mode for a KPC-3+ (GPS
# connected to the 2nd serial port).  When Xastir is actively
# getting GPS fixes, the TNC beacons only what Xastir sends to it.
# When Xastir stops getting GPS data from the TNC, the TNC will
# revert to dumb-tracker mode and start sending NMEA strings out all
# by itself at a 20-minute rate.  If the GPS get disconnected or
# turned off, the dumb-tracker mode will cease to send out beacons.
# This last function is done by the "CLEAR" parameter for the BLT
# commands.
#
# Some people prefer to turn off the GPS but still have the TNC
# beacon their last good GPS position when in dumb-tracker mode.
# To do this, remove the "CLEAR" parameters from the BLT command
# lines.
