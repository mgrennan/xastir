# This file contains definitions for the Create SAR objects menu
#
# The objects defined here are typical Public Service Event objects. 
#
# The objects defined here are ones that might be used in a public
# service event such as a 5k race.  Customize this file to fit your 
# needs.
#
# Typical modifications include internationalizing the names and menu text 
# and adding your own custom objects.  
#
# To select this file as the source of custom objects in the Create SAR
# objects menu, use the Load SAR objects menu options in the Configure
# defaults dialog (File/Configure/Defaults).
# 
# Lines begining with # are comments and will be ignored.
#
# Each line contains a tab separated variable and value pair.
# Each set of lines defines an object as specified on the prepared
# objects menu.  Each set of lines must have variables defined in the
# following order:
#
# NAME  The name of the object.
#       Maximum length = MAX_CALLSIGN - 1 or - 2, to allow for Name1, Name2
#       incrementing numbers with multiple objects.
#       If name ends with a - then the first object will be called Name-1,
#       the second Name-2, and so on.  If name does not end with a - then
#       The first object will be called Name, the second Name2.
# PAGE  The APRS symbol code page, / or \
#       Maximum length = 1 character.
# SYMBOL        The APRS symbol specifier.
        Maximum length = 1 character.
# DATA  Additional data (such as probability circles) to follow the symbol in
#       the APRS string for the object
#       Use DATA NULL if there is no additional data, or omit the DATA line.
#       Maximum length =  PREDEFINED_OBJECT_DATA_LENGTH = 44
# MENU  The text to appear on the prepared objects menu for this object.
#       Maximum length = 25 characters.
# HIDDENCHILD	NO for entries that appear on the menu.  YES for a second
# 	object to be created at the same time as the one above it.
#	This is a workaround to create an IPP and an IPP_ with different
#  	probability circles in the same place at the same time.
#       YES is case sensitive.  
#       HIDDENCHILD must be the last line in each object.
#
# NAME, PAGE, SYMBOL, MENU, and HIDDENCHILD are required for each object.
#
# Each set of lines specifying an object should be separated by a blank line 
# for clarity.  Blank lines are ignored.  
#
# The maximum number of objects that can be shown on the predefined object
# menu is defined by the constant MAX_NUMBER_OF_PREDEFINED_OBJECTS.
