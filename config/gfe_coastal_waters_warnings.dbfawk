# This dbfawk file is used to map arbitrary dbf data that accompanies
# a shapefile into Xastir canoncical values of:
#   key     - search key
#   lanes   - width of feature (usually a road but applies to rivers, etc. too)
#   color   - color to draw the road
#   name    - name of the road for labels
#   filled  - whether a polygon is drawn filled or not
#   fill_color - color to fill polygon with
#   pattern - line pattern for road, river, etc.
#   display_level - highest zoom level at which to display the feature
#   label_level - highest zoom level at which to display the label
#   symbol  - 3 char 'TIO': table, ID, overlay
#
# NOTE: This file format is modeled after awk but is nowhere near awk
#  compatible.

# This file is used to map NWS state zone area polygon shapefiles
# which are named z_ddmmyy.dbf.  These are used for WX alerts.
# For the WX alert feature, the key is set to the STATE_ZONE code,
# reformatted to match alert->title (e.g. KS033 is KS_Z033).

# BEGIN is called once per dbf file which contains multiple records.

# dbfinfo is the "signature" of the dbf file listing the column names in order.
