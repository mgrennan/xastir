Hello new user, and welcome to Xastir!


This document will take you through the steps necessary to get
Xastir up and running in one of the following configurations:


1) Minimal install, which will get you up and running quickly.  It's
   recommended that you try this configuration first then add to it.

2) Typical install including maps, weather alerts, geo-coding files,
   etc. so that full regular operation is achieved.

3) Maximum install with all configure options enabled and most of
   the useful maps loaded/enabled.  All the bells and whistles.


Note that you can start with either of the first two options and add
only the options you wish in order to come up with your own custom
configuration of Xastir.

These instructions are written for Linux users.  Windows users
should refer to the README.win32 document instead.
MacOSX/Solaris/FreeBSD users should refer to the README document
first, then the INSTALL document and the below instructions for
further notes.

One question you might ask is whether you can just find a binary on
the 'net somewhere and install it instead of compiling Xastir from
sources.  Yes, this is possible.  Xastir changes so often (bug fixes
and of course adding new features) that you're really limiting
yourself by using pre-compiled binaries.  Binaries are typically not
updated all that often, if at all, so you'll forever be behind the
curve.

Another reason to compile from sources is to customize it to use all
of the features you have available on your system.  As you add more
libraries that Xastir can use, you can do a quick
configure/compile/install and Xastir will be able to take advantage
of them.

For those that really must have the latest-latest:  Download the
Xastir sources using CVS instead, then issue the command "cvs
update" periodically in order to snag the latest changes.  If
anything comes down the pipe, just configure/make/install and then
use the latest version.  This avoids large file downloads (after the
initial download) as it just grabs _changes_ to the sources off the
'net each time you issue the "cvs update" command.  This is the
power-user's method of keeping Xastir up-to-date.  See README.CVS
for details.

After the three configuration sections there's a section on
operating, which simply talks you through the initial configuration
settings and how things work.  After that you can refer to the Help
menu option in Xastir itself, plus the INSTALL and README.* text
files for additional information.  Please note that the non-English
help files lag severely behind the English help file.

First of all, NEVER RUN XASTIR AS THE ROOT USER!  You're risking the
security of your system by attempting it.  Create another regular
user on your system and use that user for all of your normal
activity.  This goes for any other normal activity on the system as
well.  Only use the "root" account for maintenance activities, not
for regular user activities.  You'll thank me later!

Before we begin, consider subscribing to the Xastir mailing list.
That's where everyone is kept up-to-date on the latest features,
plus lots of questions are asked/answered there on a weekly or
sometimes daily basis.  It's a great way to learn and to stay
connected with the other Xastir users.  See the mailing links on the
left of the Xastir home page:  http://www.xastir.org
You must be subscribed in order to post messages there.

So...  Let's get started!


--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Latest info:

*) Xastir starts up with a default world map the first time you run
it plus pops up a dialog where you can enter your callsign.  Enter
a callsign, then close/restart Xastir or save the configuration via
"File->Configure->Save Config Now!".  Either of these methods saves
the callsign to disk.

*) Xastir includes "Shapefile" map capability by default.  Run the
script:

    "/usr/local/share/xastir/scripts/get-NWSdata"

as root to download/install NOAA Shapefile maps using the "wget"
utility.  You'll of course need wget installed in order to fetch the
files using this method.  Installing the NWS files enables weather
alert support in Xastir.  Verify that "Map->Enable Weather Alerts" is
selected and that "Map->Disable All Maps" is _not_ selected, else
you won't see weather alerts on your screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Minimal Install:
----------------

First, let's describe it:  This will get Xastir up and running with
a few built-in map types.  You'll be on the air or on the 'net
quickly, then can build upon this working base to add more map
libraries and other cool features later.


Getting the package:
--------------------
*) Option 1:  Download one of stable or development snapshots from
http://www.xastir.org.  There are links from that page or you can go
to the SourceForge page and click on Files to see the entire set
that is available.

Once you have the file, create a subdirectory for it to reside.  I
usually do this:

    cd                      # Go to my home directory
    mkdir src               # Make a "src" subdirectory
    cd src                  # Change to it
    mkdir xastir            # Make an "xastir" subdirectory
    cd xastir               # Change to it
    cp /path/filename .     # Copy the downloaded file here
    tar xzvf filename       # Un-archive the sources

That last step will create yet another xastir directory underneath
the first one but will have the version number in it, so your full
path might be something like (starting at your home directory):
~/src/xastir/xastir-1.7.0

The path just listed is where you'll go in order to run the
configure and make commands listed below.

    cd  ~/src/xastir/xastir-1.7.0

from an xterm window should take you there.

*) Option 2:  An alternative is to use CVS to snag the sources for
you.  Using this method you can periodically update to the latest
released version, the latest "stable" version, or the latest
development sources.  See README.CVS for info about that option.
One of the advantages of CVS is that you only pull down the changes
since you last updated, instead of doing very large file downloads
each time.  Another advantage is that you can keep up with the
latest features on a daily basis if you wish, nearly effortlessly.


Configure:
----------
In order to complete the configure/compile/install of Xastir, you'll
need some of the development tools and headers installed.  Here's a
list of a few items you'll need to have installed.  Look for them in
the development tools sections on your Linux distribution:


    bash
    binutils
    gcc
    gcc development headers
    cpp
    glibc
    glibc development headers?
    freetype2
    freetype2 development headers
    openmotif (or Lesstiff or Motif)
    openmotif development headers (or Lesstiff or Motif)
    XFree86
    XFree86 development headers
    XFree86 fonts
    XFree86 libraries
    make (GNU flavor, not BSD flavor)
    gzip
    m4
    grep


Note:  Only install one of the Motif packages and the corresponding
development package to go with it.  Recommendation:  OpenMotif.

If you'd like to install additional packages at this point that may
be needed later, install these as well:


    patch
    diffutils
    perl
    autoconf
    automake
    less
    bzip2
    curl
    curl development headers
    cvs
    rcs
    tar
    liblcms
    liblcms development headers
    libtiff
    less
    pcre
    pcre development headers
    tcl
    tcl development headers
    tk
    zip
    unzip
    wget
    ax25-apps
    ax25-doc
    ax25-tools
    libax25
    festival
    festival development headers
    gawk
    ghostscript-x11
    ghostscript-fonts
    ghostview
    gv
    ImageMagick
    ImageMagick development headers


Note that some packages may have dependencies on yet more packages.
Hopefully your package installation tool will take care of those for
you.  It's also common for at least one of these packages to forget
to list some of it's dependencies (ImageMagick is known for that).
In that case you may have to rely on the compiler to tell you what
is missing, then go back and re-install a package or two.

When you run the "./configure" step from the "xastir" directory, the
script will attempt to figure out what facilities are available that
Xastir can take advantage of.  Sometimes the script guesses wrong
and you must disable an option and try again.  The correct way to do
this is (Festival speech synthesizer is used as an example, not that
I'm picking on Festival or anything):

    ./configure --without-festival

That will guarantee that configure will skip Festival entirely,
which will set up the Makefiles to skip it, and the Xastir binary
will be created without any support for it.  Other configure options
are:

    --without-ax25
    --without-festival
    --without-gpsman
    --without-shapelib
    --without-imagemagick
    --without-libproj
    --without-geotiff
    --without-gdal
    --without-pcre
    --without-dbfawk
    --without-map-cache
    --with-errorpopups
    --with-rtree


That said, you probably won't have to use any of these!  Type
"./configure" all by itself and the script should eventually give
you a summary of the packages that it will try to compile support
into Xastir for.  The only time you may want to add some of the
above options is if the compile hangs up because of one of them.
You can then add the option to configure, re-create the Makefiles to
skip that feature, and get Xastir compiled without it.  Once you get
the problem solved, you can reconfigure and recompile to add that
feature back in.

At this point, if some things don't appear in the summary that you'd
like/expect to appear, as long as you get to the "Type 'make' to
build Xastir" message, you're doing fine.  You can work on getting
more things in there later.

This is what you'd like to see at the end of the "./configure" run
(minimum, there may be more "yes" answers):

  AX25.......... : no
  Festival...... : no
  GPSMan........ : no
  ImageMagick... : no
  libproj....... : no
  GeoTiff....... : no
  GDAL/OGR...... : no
  ShapeLib...... : no
  pcre.......... : no
  dbfawk........ : no
  libgc (Debug). : no

In other words, Xastir should build/compile with NO optional
libraries installed!  This will still give you USGS GNIS maps,
APRSdos maps, WinAPRS maps, and PocketAPRS maps, plus audio alerts
if you have a suitable audio player installed on your system.
You'll also be able to attach a TNC either in command-line or KISS
mode and connect it to Xastir.  Mobile support will work with an
attached serial GPS.  Attached weather stations should work fine
too.  You won't get online maps or weather alerts with this
configuration though.  Worry about that stuff later once you get the
minimal configuration working.


Make:
-----
Type "make".  That stage should complete with no errors.  You may
have a warning or two show up, depending on your compiler version
and your operating system.


Make install:
-------------
For this stage you need to have root privileges.  "root" is the
user on a Unix/Linux box that has the ultimate authority over
everything.  Follow these steps:

    su
    make install
    chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/xastir (optional, see below)
    exit

The first step takes you to root user privileges.  You'll need to
type in the root password when it asks for it.  The "make install"
step installs all of the pieces of Xastir in the appropriate places
on your system.

The "chmod" step sets up the Xastir executable so that it can assume
root privileges at the points where it needs to, usually when it
needs to access serial ports or AX.25 kernel networking ports.  Note
that if you don't need the above chmod command, don't use it.  It
will prevent creation of "core" files in case Xastir crashes, which
makes debugging to figure out the root cause much more difficult.
There are also some security risks in doing "chmod 4755", as it
makes Xastir run as the root user at times.  We've tried to minimize
the risk by giving up root permissions when we don't absolutely
require them, so the risks are smaller.

At this point you have a minimal Xastir installed.  Jump down to the
"Operating Xastir" step below.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Typical Install:
----------------

First, let's describe it:  This will give you a working Xastir with
local Shapefile maps, online street/topo/satellite-image maps,
weather alerts, and audio alerts.  Optionally you can add
synthesized speech to the mix.

You'll need to run /usr/local/share/xastir/scripts/get-NWSdata as root
after you do the install in order to get the NOAA data files you'll
need for the weather alerts.  "get-NWSdata" requires "wget" in order
to work.

This is what you'd like to see at the end of the "./configure" run
(minimum, there may be more "yes" answers):


-------------------------------------------------------------------
  MINIMUM OPTIONS:
    ShapeLib (Vector maps) ................. : yes

  RECOMMENDED OPTIONS:
    GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick (Raster maps) : yes (GraphicsMagick)
    pcre (Shapefile customization) ......... : yes
    dbfawk (Shapefile customization) ....... : yes 
    rtree indexing (Shapefile speedups) .... : no
    map caching (Raster map speedups) ...... : no
    internet map retrieval ................. : yes (libcurl)

  FOR THE ADVENTUROUS:
    AX25 (Linux Kernel I/O Drivers) ........ : no
    libproj (USGS Topos & Aerial Photos) ... : no
    GeoTiff (USGS Topos & Aerial Photos) ... : no
    Festival (Text-to-speech) .............. : no
    GDAL/OGR (Obtuse map formats) .......... : no
    GPSMan/gpsmanshp (GPS downloads) ....... : no 
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Note:  You may see "ImageMagick" instead of "GraphicsMagick" and/or
"wget" instead of "libcurl" for your installation of Xastir.  Those
are alternative packages that give similar functionality.  You may
also see "(internal)" at the end of the Shapelib line, which is fine
also.


TBD


--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Maximum Install:
----------------

First, let's describe it:  This will give you a working Xastir with
all of the non-debug "configure" options enabled, local maps, online
street/topo/satellite-image maps, weather alerts, audio alerts,
synthesized speech, Garmin RINO support, GPS download support,
search for street address capability, FCC/RAC callsign lookups, and
all of the supported map types.

This is what you'd like to see at the end of the "./configure" run:


-------------------------------------------------------------------
  MINIMUM OPTIONS:
    ShapeLib (Vector maps) ................. : yes

  RECOMMENDED OPTIONS:
    GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick (Raster maps) : yes (GraphicsMagick)
    pcre (Shapefile customization) ......... : yes
    dbfawk (Shapefile customization) ....... : yes
    rtree indexing (Shapefile speedups) .... : yes
    map caching (Raster map speedups) ...... : yes
    internet map retrieval ................. : yes (libcurl)

  FOR THE ADVENTUROUS:
    AX25 (Linux Kernel I/O Drivers) ........ : yes
    libproj (USGS Topos & Aerial Photos) ... : yes
    GeoTiff (USGS Topos & Aerial Photos) ... : yes
    Festival (Text-to-speech) .............. : yes
    GDAL/OGR (Obtuse map formats) .......... : yes
    GPSMan/gpsmanshp (GPS downloads) ....... : yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Note:  You may see "ImageMagick" instead of "GraphicsMagick" and/or
"wget" instead of "libcurl" for your installation of Xastir.  Those
are alternative packages that give similar functionality.  You may
also see "(internal)" at the end of the Shapelib line, which is fine
also.


TBD


--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Operating Xastir:
-----------------

Again, NEVER RUN XASTIR AS THE ROOT USER!  You're risking the
security of your system by attempting it.  Create another regular
user on your system and use that user for all of your normal
activity.  This goes for any other normal activity on the system as
well.  Only use the "root" account for maintenance activities, not
for regular user activities.  You'll thank me later!

Assuming you want to start Xastir up in the English language, you
can type (from an xterm window):

    xastir

which will start up the program without giving you back a
command-prompt in your xterm window (until Xastir exits), or you can
type (from an xterm window):

     xastir &

which will start Xastir in the background, giving you back your
xterm for more commands.  The typical way to start it is with
"xastir &".  Of course you can get fancier and attach it to your
window manager's menus or create an icon on your desktop which
starts it.  Those are operating system/window manager-specific, so
we won't cover how to do that here.

The first time you start Xastir it will show a default map of the
world plus pop up the File->Configure->Station dialog.  Enter a
callsign on that dialog and press the OK button.


Changing the Language:

If you want to start Xastir using some other language, you do that
with command-line switches when you start Xastir.  Once you use one
of these switches, that language option becomes "sticky", meaning
you won't have to enter that command-line switch again unless you
wish to change languages.

There are some command-line switches that you can 
If you type "xastir -?", which is an invalid command-line option,
you'll see this:

  xastir: invalid option -- h

  Xastir Command line Options

  -c /path/dir       Xastir config dir
  -f callsign        Track callsign
  -i                 Install private Colormap
  -geometry WxH+X+Y  Set Window Geometry
  -l Dutch           Set the language to Dutch
  -l English         Set the language to English
  -l French          Set the language to French
  -l German          Set the language to German
  -l Italian         Set the language to Italian
  -l Portuguese      Set the language to Portuguese
  -l Spanish         Set the language to Spanish
  -l ElmerFudd       Set the language to ElmerFudd
  -l MuppetsChef     Set the language to MuppetsChef
  -l OldeEnglish     Set the language to OldeEnglish
  -l PigLatin        Set the language to PigLatin
  -l PirateEnglish   Set the language to PirateEnglish
  -m                 Deselect Maps
  -p                 Disable popups
  -t                 Internal SIGSEGV handler enabled
  -v level           Set the debug level


Ignore those for now unless you need to change the Language.

OK, Xastir should show up on your screen at this point.  We're
assuming that you're already running X-Windows graphical environment
at this point.  If you're in command-line Linux/Unix only, Xastir
won't run.

If you've configured in ShapeLib capability, you'll need to run
/usr/local/share/xastir/scripts/get-NWSdata as the root user in order
to get the NOAA data files you'll need for the weather alerts.  The
script requires "wget" in order to work.  Run this script periodically
(once every six months perhaps?) to keep your weather alert maps
up-to-date.  If you're not in the U.S. or one of it's possessions then
you can safely ignore this download.


Various ways to manipulate Xastir:


Context-Dependent Operations:
-----------------------------
                Normal      Draw-CAD    Measure     Move
                ------      --------    -------     ----
Cursor          Arrow       Pencil      Crosshairs  Crosshairs
LeftClick                                           SelectObject
LeftDrag        ZoomToArea  ZoomToArea  MeasureArea MoveObject
MiddleClick     ZoomOut     SetCADPoint ZoomOut     ZoomOut

Alt-F, Alt-V, etc to bring up main menus via the keyboard.  Use
arrow keys to navigate menus and/or single letters corresponding to
the "hot" letter (underlined lettter) for each menu item.

"ESC" to back out of the menu system.


Global Operations:
------------------
LeftClick       Select Menu or GUI Item (when in menus or dialogs)
LeftDblClick    FetchAlertText (when in View->Wx Alerts dialog)
RightClick      OptionsMenu
Home            Center the map on your home station

PageDown        ZoomIn
ArrowUp         PanUp
ArrowDown       PanDown

"Space"         Activate current widget
"Tab"           Rotate among widgets
"Back-Tab"      Rotate among widgets backwards


Other Possible External Stimuli:
--------------------------------
Send a SIGUSR1 to cause a snapshot to be taken.
Send a SIGHUP to cause Xastir to save/quit/restart.
Send a SIGINT, SIGQUIT, or SIGTERM to cause Xastir to quit.
Connect to TCP port 2023 if Server Port is enabled to send/receive packets.
Send to UDP port 2023 via the xastir_udp_client program to inject packets.


Note that you can also tweak a define/recompile to reverse the
left/right button functions.



Configuring Xastir:
-------------------
*) Note that the menu's have a dashed line near the top.  If you
click on that dashed line it acts like a cut-line for the menu and
detaches that menu from the main menu.  You can then move that menu
off to another area of your screen.  You might try that with the
File->Configure menu at this time.

*) Go to File->Configure->Station and set your callsign.  Set up
other parameters/comment fields on this dialog that may need
setting.

*) Go to File->Configure->Defaults and set parameters there.

You have the main parameters set now.  Next is to enable some
interfaces so that you can see some packets come across.  Easiest
might be the Internet interfaces, assuming the computer you're on
has Internet access and is hooked up to it currently.

*) Run "callpass" in another Xterm window in order to generate your
Pass-code number.  Save that number as you'll need it for each
Interface dialog where you might need to authenticate your callsign.
Of course you can always run callpass again if you forget it!

*) Go to Interface->Properties then click on "Add".  Click "Internet
Server".  Another dialog will come up that allows you to enter the
Host, and the Port.  Enter your Pass-code number here.  People often
check the "Activate on Startup?" and the "Reconnect on NET failure?"
options on this box.  You may also assign a comment to this
interface which describes the interface better for you.  Click "OK"
to create the interface.  If you checked "Activate on Startup?" then
the interface will start as well and you'll be receiving packets.

Browse "http://www.aprs2.net/" to find a reasonable set of servers
to start with.  Another possibility is to use "rotate.aprs2.net"
port 14580, which theoretically should rotate among the available
second-tier servers.  See "http://www.aprs2.net" for more info.
You'll need to put in a filter string, such as "r/35/-106/500" which
shows you stations that are within 500km of 35dN/106dW (Thanks for
that one Tom!).  For additional filter settings check out:

    http://www.aprs-is.net/javaprssrvr/javaprsfilter.htm

*) Start that interface from the Interface->Start/Stop dialog if
it's not started already.  You'll see icons in the lower right
toggling and see callsigns in the lower left status box if packets
are coming in.

One thing about configuration:  Most things don't get written to
Xastir's config file until you choose either "File->Configure->Save
Config Now!" or you exit Xastir.  Map Selections however are
immediate.

*) Creating/starting interfaces for other types of devices is
similar.  If you're wanting to create AX.25 kernel networking ports
you'll have to refer to the HAM HOWTO documents and perhaps the
linux-hams mailing list for help.  For AGWPE connections refer to
that AGWPE docs and mailing list.

It's recommended that if you run a local TNC, you run it in KISS
mode.  You can do that via the Serial KISS TNC interface, or via
AX.25 Kernel Networking ports.

Some of the more esoteric types of interfaces may require some
questions on the Xastir list.  Don't be afraid to ask them as we've
all been there before.


A Note About Paths:
-------------------
New path methods were discussed early April, 2005, and are being
implemented world-wide:

    "WIDE2-2" for fixed stations, balloons, aeronautical-mobile
    "WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1" for mobiles/portables

With this system, "WIDE1-1" has replaced "RELAY".  Never use
"WIDE1-1" in anything but the first path slot.  "RELAY", "WIDE",
"TRACE", and "TRACEn-N" are deprecated and should not be used
anymore.

If you want to insert a single hop callsign later in the path use
"WIDE2-1" instead, for example:  "WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1" will go exactly
two hops and use _either_ home fill-in digi's or mountaintop digi's
for the first hop, mountaintop digi's only for the second hop.

Home fill-in digi's (only where absolutely needed) should be set up
to respond to "WIDE1-1" instead of "RELAY".


A Note About the Map Directory:
-------------------------------
The map directory (/usr/local/share/xastir/maps/) is free-form,
meaning you can have links in there, subdirectories, etc.  Organize
it in any way that makes sense to you.  From within the Map Chooser
you can select a directory name, which will select every map
underneath that directory, so keep that in mind while organizing
your maps.


Enabling Weather Alerts:
------------------------
You must have Shapelib compiled into Xastir.  Xastir now comes with
Shapelib support built-in.  PRCE/dbfawk are optional.  Install NOAA
shapefile maps as specified in README.MAPS.  These files must be
installed into the /usr/local/share/xastir/Counties/ directory.  You
may use this script to download/install them for you:
    
    "/usr/local/share/xastir/scripts/get-NWSdata"

which must be run as the root user, and requires "wget" to work.

A neat trick:  You can copy some of these maps into the
/usr/local/share/xastir/maps directory somewhere (a new subdirectory
under there is always fine), then you can select some of these maps
as regular Xastir maps as well.


Enabling FCC/RAC Callsign Lookup:
---------------------------------

Run the /usr/local/share/xastir/scripts/get-fcc-rac.pl script as root,
which will download and install the proper databases into the
/usr/local/share/xastir/fcc/ directory.  At that point the callsign
lookup features in the Station Info dialog and in the "Station->Find
Station" menu option should be functional.


Enabling Map Feature Lookup:
----------------------------
Install USGS GNIS files into the /usr/local/share/xastir/GNIS/
directory.  Call out the proper file when invoking the "Map->Locate
Map Feature" menu option.  Note that if you also link a subdirectory
name under the maps directory back to the
/usr/local/share/xastir/GNIS/ directory, you'll be able to use the
GNIS files as maps under the Map Chooser as well.  See README.MAPS
for how to do this.


Enabling Street Address Lookup:
-------------------------------
Download the USA.geocode file and install it into the
/usr/local/share/xastir/GNIS/ directory.  This will enable the
"Map->Find Address" menu option to work.  Xastir will place a big
"X" on the map at the street address it finds for you.  This file is
sometimes available at http://www.dementia.org/geocoder/tgr2003/
As an alternative you can download the individual state files that
are located there.


Enabling Audio Alarms:
----------------------
Download and install sample audio files from Xastir's SourceForge
download site.  Install the audio files in
/usr/local/share/xastir/sounds/ directory.

Install a command-line audio player.  Call out the path/name of that
player in the File->Configure->Audio Alarms dialog.  Common ones are
vplay and auplay, but there are many others.  Enable the types of
alarms you desire in that same dialog.

You should be able to test it manually from a shell by typing the
command in something like this:  vplay filename

Once you find a command that works, type it into Xastir's Audio
Alarms dialog exactly the same except omit the filename.


Enabling Synthesized Speech:
----------------------------
*) MacOSX
    TBD

*) Windows
    TBD

*) Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris
Install the Festival Speech Synthesizer.  Configure/compile support
for it into Xastir.  Start up the Festival server before starting
Xastir.  Xastir should start up and connect to the server.  Use the
options in File->Configure->Speech to decide which things you'd like
Xastir to speak to you about.

Note that the Proximity Alert option in the File->Configure->Speech
dialog uses the distances set in the File->Configure->Audio Alarms
dialog.


Enabling GPS Waypoint/Track/Route Download Support:
---------------------------------------------------
Install GPSMan and gpsmanshp.  Configure/compile support for it in
Xastir.  Start up GPSMan separately and configure it for your GPS
and serial port.  You'll see download options for each type on the
Interface menu.

Note that Xastir requires a version of gpsman at least as recent as 6.1.  Older
versions of gpsman may not work.


Enabling Garmin RINO Support:
-----------------------------
Install GPSMan (and gpsmanshp if you wish normal GPS download
support as well).  Configure/compile support for it in Xastir.
Start up GPSMan separately and configure it for your GPS and serial
port.  In the "File->Configure->Timing" dialog you'll see an option
for "RINO -> Objects Interval".  That sets the interval at which
Xastir will download waypoints from an attached RINO unit.  Any
waypoints that begin with "APRS" will have the "APRS" chopped off,
and the remaining name will be used to create APRS(tm) Objects.  Those
objects will be plotted on the map and transmitted as well if
transmit for objects/items is enabled.
TBD


Transmit Enable/Disable Options:
--------------------------------
Each interface has a separate transmit enable.  The Interface menu
also has a few global transmit enables.  All of these must be
enabled for a particular interface to transmit.  Also, for Internet
servers, you typically need to authenticate with the server using
your callsign/pass-code before you're allowed to inject packets into
the Internet stream which may get gated out to RF.  If you just want
to talk to other Internet users, you don't need a pass-code to
authenticate to the servers.


Igating Options:
----------------
There are igating options on each local TNC interface.  There are
other global igating options on the File->Configure->Defaults
dialog.  The global option sets restrictions on all igating.


Where stuff is kept:
-------------------- 

Per-user configurations are kept in each user's ~/.xastir directory, by
default.  In particular the ~/.xastir/config/xastir.cnf file is where most
of the configs are kept.  This directory can be optionally specified using
the -c /path/dir command line option.  Make sure you specify a directory,
not a file!  Xastir will create the directory and several subdirectories if
they do not exist when you start up. 

A few executables are installed in /usr/local/bin/.

Scripts are installed in /usr/local/share/xastir/scripts.

Maps are installed in /usr/local/share/xastir/maps/.  Lots of other
directories are under /usr/local/share/xastir/.
