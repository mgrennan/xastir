# This script will ask for an item designator, then create a file
# with that name + ".log" in the ~/.xastir/logs directory.  The
# file will contain APRS items created from the downloaded Garmin
# tracklog.  Reading that log file with Xastir will result in an
# object with a track being displayed on the map screen.

# You may wish to bump up MAX_TRACKS in db.h to 1024 in order to see
# the entire log, but be careful with Xastir's memory image growing
# too fast if you're connected to the 'net after making this change.

# This script uses the GPS::Garmin module which can be obtained
# from http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-gps/
