# This script will send the proper characters to STDOUT to command a
# KISS TNC out of KISS mode.  Redirect it to the port that the TNC
# is connected to.  Turn off the port in Xastir first.

# It is assumed that the baud rate on the port and the baud rate of
# the TNC match, if not, this won't work.  If you've just been using
# the TNC in Xastir, they probably match.

# Use the script like this:
#
# ./kiss-off.pl >/dev/ttyS1
#


sleep 1;
printf("%c%c%c", 192, 255, 192);
