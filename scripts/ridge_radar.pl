# This script takes a single argument:  The abbreviation of the
# radar station off of the NWS site, and outputs to STDOUT a .geo
# file that should be correct.
# NOTE:  You'll need to install "LWP::UserAgent" and "Image::Size"
# from CPAN to make it work.
#
# Here's a typical invocation which creates a NYC Ridge Radar .geo
# file called OKX_NOR.geo:
#
#       ./ridge_radar.pl OKX > OKX_NOR.geo
#
# Of course you'd typically put the resulting file in your Xastir
# maps directory and reindex maps to make it available for use.
