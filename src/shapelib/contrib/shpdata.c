 * shpdata.c  - utility program for testing elements of the libraries
 *
 *
 * $Log: shpdata.c,v $
 * Revision 1.3  2010/07/11 07:51:03  we7u
 * Fixing more compiler warnings.  There are a few left yet.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2010/07/11 07:24:37  we7u
 * Fixing multiple minor warnings with Shapelib.  Still plenty left.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2006/11/10 21:48:10  tvrusso
 * Add shapelib as an internal library, and use it if we don't find an external
 * one.
 *
 * Make a loud warning if we do so, because the result of this is that we'll
 * have a bigger executable.
 *
 * This commit is bigger than it needs to be, because it includes all of
 * shapelib, including the contrib directory.
 *
 * Added an automake-generated Makefile for this thing.
 *
 * Builds only a static library, and calls it "libshape.a" instead of
 * "libshp.a" so that if we use ask to use the static one while there is
 * also an external one installed, the linker doesn't pull in the shared
 * library one unbidden.
 *
 * This stuff can be tested on a system with libshp installed by configuring with
 * "--without-shapelib"
 *
 * I will be removing Makefile.in because it's not supposed to be in CVS.  My
 * mistake.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1999/05/26 02:56:31  candrsn
 * updates to shpdxf, dbfinfo, port from Shapelib 1.1.5 of dbfcat and shpinfo
 *
