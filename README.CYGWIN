Note that there are other options to get Xastir running on Win32.
The method described below in this document is for getting Xastir
running under Cygwin which can be problematic.  Other methods exist
on the Xastir Wiki pages which are typically easier and more robust:

  In the past, two companies have created simpler installs of 
  Cygwin/Xastir than described in this document.  Contact one of 
  these folks for more info.  Remember to replace the "at" below 
  with the "@" symbol to arrive at the correct e-mail addresses.  
  We have to do that to prevent large amounts of spam from going to

------------------------------------
Installing Xastir on Windows/Cygwin:
------------------------------------

These directions assume that you installed Cygwin after the new version
was released in January of 2010.  If you had Cygwin installed before
then, it is simpler to delete the Cygwin directory and the Start Menu
entries than to upgrade your existing install to the new version.

System Requirements:

CPU: at least 1Ghz
Memory: at least 512Meg with at least 1Gig of swap space
OS: Windows 2000 or later
Time: At least 6 hours if not using the get-maptools.sh script
      24 to 48 hours if using the script


Please Note:  It's beneficial to actually log in to your Windows
computer rather than skipping that step of the Windows login process
(Don't hit escape just to get rid of the dialog!).  If you log into
Windows properly, Cygwin will be able to figure out where to put your
home directory.  If you don't do this, you'll be referred to as
"unknown" and you won't have a home directory in Cygwin.  This means
there won't be a good place to put your Xastir startup files.  Of
course, log in as the same user each time in order for Cygwin to use
the proper home directory for you.

CAN'T REPLACE FILES:  Every once in a while Windows will refuse to
allow you to delete/rename one of the files.  The only way I've
found to get around this problem is to reboot.  Also, Windows
typically won't allow you to replace a file that Windows currently
has open.  If you're going to be recompiling/reinstalling Xastir, or
updating Cygwin, make sure that these applications are shut down
before doing so.  You can get VERY strange results if only some
files get updated.

SPACES IN USERNAMES:  Cygwin specifically, and Unix boxes in
general, don't much like spaces in filenames, directories, or login
names.  Any of these may cause you headaches while playing with
Cygwin.  Create a new login that doesn't have spaces and log in as
that user before installing Cygwin, and whenever you intend to run
Cygwin/Xastir.  It's very likely that Xastir won't work for you if
you use a login that has spaces embedded in it.  For additional
info, see this link:

    http://cygwin.com/faq/faq_2.html#SEC17

Explanation of this login box for those that don't see it:  If you
have the option of running networking, you'll have a login box show
up when you first start up Windows.  It'll ask for you user name and
password, then let you in.  If you escape out of that dialog, Windows
may start right up but networking will be disabled.

If you don't see that box, there are two options that I know about,
either you or someone else set it up to auto-login with your user/
password combo, or you don't have networking installed at all.

The following steps direct you through installing Cygwin, Xastir, and
a few optional map libraries that Xastir can use.  Note that in most
of the places below where the directions state to type commands, this
must be done from within a Cygwin BASH shell, not a DOS window.
Where you are asked to edit files, it's best to use Wordpad instead
of Notepad, as Notepad doesn't do nice things to Unix-format files.

Cygwin now allows you to have Xwindows apps and Windows apps all on
the screen and visible at the same time!  The instructions here set
it up in that manner, so you can have Xastir as just another app on
your Windows desktop.

Please subscribe to the "xastir" mailing list at
"http://www.xastir.org".  There are lots of helpful people there
that can aid you in installing/running Xastir.  You must be subscribed
in order to post messages there.


[ ] Step 1)  Install Cygwin, a free download.


[ ] Step 1a) Go to http://www.cygwin.com with your web browser.
Look for the black and green Cygwin icon, then click on "Install
now!".

This will load the Cygwin network installer program onto your
computer.  Remember where you decide to put this program.  I put
mine in "c:\<login>\cygwin\setup.exe", (for instance
"c:\hacker\cygwin\setup.exe").  This program will allow you to do a
network install of Cygwin.  After you install Cygwin (see the steps
below for details) you'll have a package directory (in my case
"c:\hacker\cygwin\") and a Cygwin directory (in my case
"c:\cygwin").  The un-installed packages go into the package
directory as they are downloaded from the 'net.

It will be beneficial to re-run the Cygwin network installer from
time to time in order to keep Cygwin up to date.  Each time you run
it you'll update any packages that have been changed since you last
ran it.

[ ] Step 1b)  Find the "setup.exe" program and execute it either by:

  a) Clicking on it with File Explorer, or
  b) Start->Run->path to executable, or
  c) Opening a DOS window and typing the name.

This will start installing Cygwin over the network.  Answers to
provide to the program:

    Install from Internet (*)
    "C:\cygwin"
    Install For All Users
    Default Text File Type Unix (*)
    Local Package Directory "C:\hacker\cygwin"
    Select Your Internet Connection (choose one)
    Choose A Download Site (choose one nearby if you can determine that)

Note:  Responses above listed with a "(*)" are required.  Others are
up to the individual user to answer as they wish.  You'll get to a
"Progress" page where "setup.bz2" is downloaded from the 'net.  If
it hangs at this step, you may wish to "Cancel" and try another
server until you obtain this file and are presented with a list of
packages to install.


[ ] Step 1c)  Select Packages:  Leave the packages selected that
were selected by default, plus select the additional packages listed
below.  Note that enabling some of these packages causes others to
be selected as well, that's OK and necessary.

[ ] Press the "View" button until it says "Full" next to it.  All
packages are now in alphanumeric sorted order.

Selecting a package involves clicking on the little circle symbol
until the option you want is displayed.  You can choose older
versions of a package, choose to keep the package you have installed
already, or choose to remove or install a package in this manner.
If you're running Cygwin install again and see "Keep" as an option,
that means you've already installed that package.  We're only
concerned with the "bin" packages here (stands for "binary") and not
the "src" packages (source code).

It's suggested that you keep whatever was selected by default, and
just add the below packages to the selection.  As you select
packages, other packages may be selected for you that are also
required:

[ ] autoconf
[ ] automake
[ ] binutils
[ ] bzip2
[ ] curl
[ ] cvs
[ ] db4.x (pick the highest number listed for x)
[ ] diffutils
[ ] font-adobe-* (pick all of them)
[ ] font-bitstream-* (pick all of them)
[ ] font-util
[ ] font-xfree86-type1
[ ] gcc4

[ ] gcc4-fortran (if you are going to use the get-maptools script)
[ ] gcc4-objc (if you are going to use the get-maptools script)

[ ] GraphicsMagick
[ ] gv
[ ] gzip
[ ] jasper
[ ] jbigkit
[ ] lcms
[ ] less
[ ] lesstif
[ ] libbz2-devel
[ ] libcurl-devel
[ ] libjasper-devel
[ ] liblcms-devel
[ ] libdb4.x (pick the same x as db2.x above)
[ ] libdb4.x-devel (pick the same x as db2.x above)
[ ] libfontconfig-devel

[ ] libgeotiff (if you are NOT going to use the get-maptools script)
[ ] libgeotiff-devel (if you are NOT going to use the get-maptools script)
[ ] libgeotiff1 (if you are NOT going to use the get-maptools script)

[ ] libGraphicsMagick-devel
[ ] libGraphicsMagick3
[ ] libjbig-devel
[ ] libpcrecpp-devel
[ ] libpng*-devel (pick the number that matches the already selected libpng* library)

[ ] libproj-devel (if you are NOT going to use the get-maptools script)
[ ] libproj1 (if you are NOT going to use the get-maptools script)

[ ] libtiff-devel
[ ] libtool
[ ] libwmf-devel
[ ] libX11-devel
[ ] libXext-devel
[ ] libXm-devel
[ ] libxml2-devel
[ ] m4
[ ] make
[ ] nano (a windows-style text editor, optional)
[ ] patch
[ ] pcre
[ ] perl

[ ] proj (if you are NOT going to use the get-maptools script)

[ ] python
[ ] rcs
[ ] tcltk
[ ] tiff 
[ ] unzip
[ ] vim (a Unix-style text editor, optional)
[ ] wget (Optional: Can use libcurl instead)
[ ] X-start-menu-icons (may take a minute to respond because it turns on many others)
[ ] xextproto

[ ] zip

Clicking on the small circle with the two arrows will run you
through the various select/de-select options for each package.


[ ] Step 1d)  Click Next and the packages will get downloaded and
installed.  Repeat the above if you have network difficulties, until
the install succeeds completely.

Some servers fail to download some files and require the user to
press enter between downloads when it fails on these files.  If this
happens, back up and select another server.


[ ] Step 1e)  At the end of the install it'll ask you if you wish to
create desktop icons and menu entries.  Definitely select these!  It
doesn't mean that Cygwin will start automatically each time you
reboot your computer or login (it doesn't start automatically).  It
_does_ mean that you'll have an icon to click on manually to get
things going.

This will create a Black/Green Cygwin icon on the desktop and a menu
entry so that you can start Cygwin through the menu system as well.

[ ] Step 1f) Click "Finish".  Cygwin is now installed.  One more
pop-up informs you Cygwin has been installed.  Sometimes this last
dialog gets hidden behind other windows, and it does seem to need OK
clicked to complete the installation.  Click the OK button on that
last dialog to _really_ complete the installation.

The Black/Green Cygwin icon will start up a BASH window, without
starting up Xwindows.  Think of it as being similar to a DOS window,
but with a lot more power.  It understands Unix commands though, not
DOS commands.

[ ] Note:  I've had the Cygwin network install fail before during
the downloading stage without informing me in any recognizable
manner.  You might which to re-do step 1 to make sure nothing
further gets downloaded/installed.  Once you get to that point, Step
1 is complete.

[ ] Step 2) Reboot.  Yes, I know that "modern Windows" doesn't always
require this but you just installed a lot of stuff including a DLL.

[ ] Step 3)  (optional) Create shortcut for starting X:

Click on START / Programs (or All Programs) / Cywgin-X

Right-click on XWin-Server and then click on Send-to / Desktop
(create Shortcut) to copy that Start Menu entry to a icon
on your Desktop

[ ] Step 4)  Test Cygwin and create startup shortcuts:

Double-click on the shortcut you just made.  You should get a shell
window that looks very much like a DOS window.  It's a BASH shell
window and understands Unix commands instead of DOS commands.

You should see an 'X' in your system tray.  That's the
X-server running.  

Once you've gotten to this stage, you now have Cygwin and Xwindows
installed and operational.  Next we go after Xastir itself.

[ ] Step 5)  Create a file at C:\cygwin\home\<user>\ called
".cvsrc", where the "<user>" part is your Windows login name.  Don't
forget the leading period in the filename as it's important.  For
instance, I created a file:  "C:\cygwin\home\hacker\.cvsrc".  The
file should contain the following lines:

    cvs -z3
    update -P -d
    status -v
    diff -u

The '#' marks comment out the first line.  "cvs -z3" invokes
compression, and the SourceForge site isn't performing compression
currently.

PLEASE NOTE:  this file must be created in Unix format, not DOS
format.  DO NOT USE Notepad or other Windows tools to create the
file, as CVS will not recognize the contents.  Thanks to Kirk
Mefford <kc2elo@softhome.net> for noticing this.  The editor "nano"
can be invoked from a Cygwin window to create this file, or for
those of you who know "vi" or have Windows editors available that
can save in Unix format, use those.  If you don't, the "cvs update"
commands won't work for you, at least until you recreate the file in
Unix format.  You've been warned!

The "." in ".cvsrc" makes it a Unix hidden file, and it won't appear
in most Unix listings.  Unix files don't need a file extension, so
don't create a file that has one (or else rename it to ".cvsrc" when
done).

Another option is to create the file using a Windows editor, then
run a dos2unix program on it to convert it to the proper format.


[ ] Step 5)  Download Xastir sources.  Start up Xwindows using your
shortcut.  Type the six lines below into the shell exactly as shown.
Hit <ENTER> when asked for a password after typing line four (the
"login" command):

  cd ~
  touch .cvspass
  mkdir src
  cd src
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir login 
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xastir.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xastir co xastir 

NOTE:  The "login" command must complete without errors in order to
create a dummy blank password in your .cvspass file.  Without this
password you'll have trouble with later CVS commands.  If you see
"EOF", "connection reset by peer", "connection refused", or "timed
out", it means that the anonymous CVS server at SourceForge is
overloaded (too many users).  Keep trying the failed commands until
they succeed!  Notice that up-arrow (on the keyboard) and then
<ENTER> will repeat the last command, saving you some typing.

The end result when it succeeds  will be a new directory
"C:\cygwin\home\<user>\src\xastir\" which contains all of the Xastir
source code.  You can type "ls xastir" (that's lower-case LS) to see
the file listing.

Side Note:  Here's the coolest thing about CVS:  Once you've done
this initial source-code download, you'll never have to do the whole
Xastir download again.  You'll just go into the "src/xastir"
directory and type "cvs update", which will snag just the _changes_
to the files since you last updated, and is very fast.  Compile and
install at that point and you'll be running the latest developer's
version in just a few minutes!  It's very easy to keep up with the
developers this way.


[ ] Step 6)  Configure/compile/install Xastir.  Type these commands
into the BASH shell, waiting until each one completes before typing
the next command:

    cd ~/src/xastir
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install

NOTE:  You'll probably want to run the configure step from an xterm
window with the X11 server running of course.  If you do this from a
non-X11 window then the configure test for "gv" will fail, as "gv"
requires an X11 server even when asking it for it's version number.
Without "gv" support you won't be able to print from Xastir.
 
NOTE:  The "make" step can be extremely memory hungry.  If you don't
have much free memory, that step might take a long time to run.  One
Win2k machine with only 20MB of free RAM (128MB total RAM) couldn't
complete this step, but adding another 128MB of RAM to that machine
caused it to succeed.  Another machine running Win2k with 64MB free
(128MB total RAM) took six hours (but keep reading!).  Free up
memory if you're having trouble completing that step.  This behavior
is only seen on Windows/Cygwin, not on the Unix-based systems.  On a
typical Linux box that step takes under two seconds.  Hopefully
Cygwin linking will improve over time to alleviate this issue.
We've added a new link-stage parameter to reduce the memory usage
for that step, but it doesn't totally resolve the problem.  The
machine that took six hours originally now takes 60 seconds to
complete that step.

Ignore the "PACKAGE_* redefined" warnings.  They won't break
anything and are just an annoyance.

Once you get through the above commands, Xastir is compiled and
installed on your system, with minimal map support.  Later sections
of this document detail adding additional map libraries in order to
give you access to the full mapping capability of Xastir.

NOTE:  If you get the below errors during the compile it means that
Cygwin has changed one of their packages to be incompatible with the
rest (and needs to change a lot more of their packages to
correspond).  It also means that you probably had Cygwin installed
previous to January 2010 and upgraded rather than replaced your
installation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/include/Xm/Print.h:28:34: X11/extensions/Print.h: No such file or directory
In file included from /usr/include/Xm/XmAll.h:79,
                 from alert.c:308:
/usr/include/Xm/Print.h:40: error: parse error before "XPContext"
/usr/include/Xm/Print.h:43: error: parse error before '}' token
/usr/include/Xm/Print.h:61: error: parse error before "XPFinishProc"
make[3]: *** [alert.o] Error 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A temporary fix for the above errors (until Cygwin gets their act
together) is to do the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Launch the Cygwin setup program
    When you get to the list of packages change the list to FULL mode
    Uncheck "Hide Obsolete Packages"
    Scroll down the list until you find xorg-x11-devel
    Click on the word "keep" until it changes to a 6.x version of the file
    Click Next and finish the setup
    Unfortunately you'll have to perform the same fix each time you
      use the Cygwin setup program or it will "upgrade" to the
      broken package again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Step 8)  Actually run the darn thing:

Let's start from scratch to make sure it all works.  Close any
Cygwin/BASH windows you may have.

Click on the shortcut you created to start Xwindows.

From the resulting BASH window, type "LANG=C xastir &".  Xastir should
start up shortly.

Note:  Xastir has support for PocketAPRS, DosAPRS, WinAPRS, MacAPRS
and GNIS maps by default.  For additional types of maps, you'll need
to install some libraries, then recompile Xastir so that it knows to
use them.  See the instructions below.

The README.MAPS file has instructions for where to get maps and where
to put them under the Xastir hierarchy.

If you have any WinAPRS, DosAPRS, or PocketAPRS maps, now is a good
time to place them in the /cygwin/usr/local/share/xastir/maps folder
(or a subdirectory of it).  You can also use "*.geo" files and the
associated image files with Xastir.  You may place them in this
directory (or a subdirectory of it) as well, though most of the .geo
files won't work for you until you install the ImageMagick library.

What Xastir paths look like from within Windows (in case you're
moving maps around with Explorer):  Just prefix them all with
"cygwin/".  For instance, maps go into
/cygwin/usr/local/share/xastir/maps instead of
/usr/local/share/xastir/maps.  Xastir will continue to see them as
"/usr/local/share/xastir/maps" though from inside Cygwin.  It kind
of looks like a miniature Unix box from inside Cygwin.

Run Windows in 15-bit color or better (32768 colors or more) or
you'll get lots of warnings about Xastir not being able to allocate
colors when it starts up, and the display will be rather stark
looking.

To set a new language or change the language current choice, use
this command line instead from inside an Xterm:

     xastir -l <language>

Current choices are:

    Dutch English French German Italian Portuguese Spanish
    ElmerFudd MuppetsChef OldeEnglish PigLatin PirateEnglish

This option will be stored in the users config file for the next
time Xastir is run. On new installs Xastir will default to English
until you use this command line option once.

Another difference with Cygwin as opposed to Unix-like operating
systems:  You can't do the make install portion if Xastir is up and
running.  You have to kill Xastir first before you do "make install"
or "make install-strip".  Otherwise the newly compiled Xastir won't
replace the old one.

Note that one user running Cygwin on XP had it crash every time his
screen-saver kicked in.  Disabling the screen-server fixed that
problem.

Another interesting "feature" of Cygwin/Xwindows is that some of the
modifier keys like ScrollLock/CapsLock/NumLock must be pressed while
that X-window is the active foreground window.  If not, the event
can be missed, and Xwindows can get out of sync with the actual
state of the key.  This doesn't appear to be an Xastir-specific
problem, but a Cygwin/Xwindow problem.  With just a BASH shell under
Cygwin (not involving Xwindows), the problem doesn't appear to
happen.  Just inside Xwindows on Cygwin.

Some users have experienced problems with their Windows box running
the NTFS "convert.exe" program instead of the ImageMagick
"convert.exe" program, usually when enabling snapshots in Xastir.
If you experience this, check your path settings and make sure that
ImageMagick's path is first.

When specifying serial ports to use with Xastir,

    "COM1" is called "/dev/ttyS0" in Cygwin (and Linux)
    "COM2" is called "/dev/ttyS1" in Cygwin (and Linux)

Note the capital 'S'.


[ ] Step 9)  Document & Back Up the Configuration

One user had a problem where after Cygwin/Xastir was installed, he
installed another program, in this case Java, and it wiped out some
of the environment variables that Cygwin set.  $HOME was one
variable that got changed.

To guard against such changes, go to My Computer and right-click on
properties.  Write down the Advanced System Variables and keep the
note in a safe place.


Optional


Please see the INSTALL file and the Help menu in Xastir itself
for additional information not mentioned in this document.

Additional info can be found on the cygwin web-site:

    http://www.cygwin.com

or the Cygwin/XFree86 web-site:

    http://cygwin.com/xfree/


[ ] Step 10)  Keeping up-to-date:

Once a week or once a month, run the Cygwin network installer
program (step 1b above).  After it finishes, open a Cygwin window
and type these commands to update the Xastir source code:

    cd ~/src/xastir
    cvs update

If you see "EOF" or "connection reset by peer" it means that the
anonymous CVS server at SourceForge is overloaded (too many users).
Keep trying the failed commands until they succeed!  Notice that
up-arrow (on the keyboard) and then <ENTER> will repeat the last
command, saving you some typing.

Every once in a while Windows will refuse to allow you to
delete/rename one of the files.  The only way I've found to get
around this problem is to reboot.  I sometimes see this when trying
to do a CVS update, and Windows won't allow one or more files to get
updated.

Repeat step 6) above to recompile/reinstall the latest Xastir.

A very good option is to read the SUDO instructions in the
README.CVS file, setting up the /etc/sudoers file and creating an
update-xastir script as shown.  Then you can type "./update-xastir"
at any time to snag down the latest Xastir changes, compile, and
install it.  We've just included an update-xastir script with
Xastir, so you don't have to create it anymore.  You may however
need to remove the "sudo" keyword from each line for it to work
properly on Cygwin.


-----

-------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL:  ADDING ADDITIONAL MAP LIBRARIES:
-------------------------------------------

These additional Xastir libraries have been tested on Cygwin:

    ImageMagick
    Shapelib
    libtiff
    libproj
    libgeotiff
    Festival
    GDAL/OGR (broken as of January 2010 - kd7myc)

Anyone testing additional libraries is encouraged to share their
findings on the Xastir mailing lists (you must be subscribed in
order to post messages there).  The libraries which have _not_ been
made to work yet on Cygwin are:

    AX25
    GPSMan/gpsmanshp

The AX25 libraries will probably never work, as they are for Linux
only.  GPSMan/gpsmanshp may work on Cygwin at some point if enough
work is done to figure out and document the process.


RECOMMENDED:  Adding maptools:

*******************************NOTE**************************************
As of 10 November 2006, xastir's source tree contains a copy of shapelib
1.2.10, and automatically builds shapelib if you don't have it installed.

    cd ~/src/xastir/scripts
    ./get-maptools.sh
    come back in six to 48 hours
    
The last thing the script tries to do is compile GDAL.  This is currently
broken.  Don't worry.  The rest should have been installed just fine.

[ ] Now you should be ready to configure and compile Xastir with
Shapelib support.  Type these commands:

    cd ~/src/xastir
    cvs update
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install


See the README.MAPS file for where to get the maps.


OPTIONAL:  Install Festival support:
------------------------------------
Allows using a synthesized voice from within Xastir for alerts,
reading messages to you, and other cool things.  Tom Russo did the
initial work on this, Henk de Groot optimized it:

1) Start BASH shell in Cygwin

2) Make ~/festival download directory and
    /usr/local/festival installation directory

3) Download festival components from festvox.org into ~/festival, in
   the Windows environment the corresponding path is:

     C:\Cygwin\home\%USERNAME%\festival

    get the following files:

     speech_tools-1.2.95-beta.tar.gz
     festival-1.95-beta.tar.gz
     festlex-CMU.tar.gz
     festlex-POSLEX.tar.gz
     festvox-kallpc16k.tar.gz

4) Build festival and company:

    cd /usr/local/festival
    tar xzf ~/festival/speech_tools-1.2.95-beta.tar.gz
    tar xzf ~/festival/festival-1.95-beta.tar.gz
    tar xzf ~/festival/festlex_CMU.tar.gz
    tar xzf ~/festival/festlex_POSLEX.tar.gz
    tar xzf ~/festival/festvox_kallpc16k.tar.gz

    cd speech_tools
    ./configure && make
    cd ../festival
    ./configure && make

   These packages are build and used where they are compiled.

5) Test festival:

    cd /usr/local/festival/festival/examples
    sh saytime

   Festival should say the time if everything went fine

6) Add /festival/festival/bin to PATH in .profile and .bashrc. For
   me both files look like this:

    .profile and .bashrc:
    -------------------
    export PATH=$PATH:/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/X11R6/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/festival/festival/bin:~/bin:.

    -------------------

7) Configure and build xastir.  Configure should report that
   festival is found.

8) Start the festival server:

    festival --server &

   To do this automatically I added the following lines to my
   .bash_profile:

    -------------------
    if  [ `ps -ef | grep festival | wc -l` -eq 0 ]
    then
      festival --server &
      sleep 1
    fi
    -------------------

9) Run xastir, do File->Configure->Speech, add things to say, and
   listen.



How to make Sound Alerts work under Cygwin
------------------------------------------
(from Kirk Mefford, kc2elo)
"I figured I'd share exactly what I did to make the sound alerts work in
xastir under Cygwin. Sound support seems to be just one of the many quirks
of trying to use *nix native software under Microsoft OS's. Hope this helps
someone else.

FYI: This was tested under Win2000

Sound alert support under Cygwin using Network Audio Server (NAS)

I downloaded http://nas.intra-links.net/files/nas-1.6-win-binary.zip and
decompressed the archive with winzip (any zip utility should work fine) into
a temporary folder.

I deleted the "cygwin1.dll" and "README.txt" files that came in the package
since they aren't needed and the extra cygwin1.dll can cause problems.


  Note from James Cour, K1ZC:
  ---------------------------
  "The procedure he (Kirk) outlines there works fine EXCEPT that
  there is a valuable piece of information in that Readme.txt file...
  The user must have a folder named /DEV under the Cygwin folder in
  order for NASD to work.  NASD will not create it automatically, and
  NASD will not run without it.  The default set-up instructions for
  Xastir and Cygwin do not create this folder, so the user needs to
  manually create the folder from Windows."


  Note from Tim Baggett, AA5DF:
  -----------------------------
  "I recommend running the script (create_devices.sh) found attached
  to the email located at the URL below to create the /dev directory,
  and all supported devices under Cygwin."

  "http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2004-01/msg00353.html"


Then copy the remaining files from the package into the /bin directory under
cygwin.

All that is needed to make nas available to xastir is to load the server
before running xastir.

To load NAS for xastir to use simply type "nasd -local -b" from cygwin. This
command will load the NAS server in the background and will only allow local
users to access it.  For more command options type "nasd -help" from within
cygwin.  Some people have trouble with the "-local" option, so try
it without that option as well ("nasd -b").

After NAS is loaded you can load xastir as you normally would.

Once xastir is running, to play sound alerts you need to change the default
configuration to use "auplay"

From within xastir click on File>Configure>Audio Alarms.
The "Audio Play Command" box should be changed to "auplay"
Then ensure the audio files listed to play are located in
"/usr/local/share/xastir/sounds" directory.

Click OK to accept the changes and be sure to save your config before
exiting xastir or sound will not work the next time it is loaded.

Turn up the volume on your PC speakers and enjoy the noise xastir makes."


OPTIONAL:  Install GDAL/OGR support:
------------------------------------
One user has been successful in compiling GDAL/OGR support into
Xastir.  One thing he mentioned:

"Now the word of warning.  If you try to compile GDAL under Cygwin
and the compile blows up, you are better rm -rvf'ing the entire
directory and re-untaring the source again than trying to recompile
in that blown directory.  Make Clean doesn't do a thing and the old
settings and mistakes stick around no matter what you try."

Make sure you've got Shapelib installed on your system else Xastir
won't find GDAL (the private Xastir copy of Shapelib is fine).  Both
are needed.

Download "gdal-1.2.0b.tar.gz".  In a cygwin window, type the
following:


    tar xzvf gdal-1.2.0b.tar.gz
    cd gdal-1.2.0b
    ./configure --with-jpeg=internal --with-libtiff=internal
    make
    make install


The GDAL/OGR library should now be installed on your system.  Return
to the xastir directory and start with the ./configure command.  It
should pick up the fact that GDAL/OGR has been installed and compile
support for it into Xastir.  Follow with the rest of the commands to
make/install Xastir.

One user required the below GDAL configure line as otherwise it
complained about not finding libproj:

    ./configure --with-jpeg=internal --with-libtiff=internal --with-static-proj4
